# Convert ichat Files
If you have isolated .ichat files on your hard drive and wish that you didn't have to open them with iChat/Messages in order to read them, then this program is for you; it will convert .ichat files to either RTF or plain-text, depending on your preference. For documentation, simply run the program without any arguments. A shell script is provided for running the program on a directory full of .ichat files, since it only converts one file at a time.

Notes:
- This program was developed only as far as was needed to convert my set of test files (about 600 logs).  It's likely that there are various quirks in .ichat files out there in the wild that this program does not account for; feel free to report a bug if you find one.
- This program is not fully Unicode-friendly, so names in a non-English alphabet may not be supported without a little additional work.
